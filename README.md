# Identification of fish sounds in the wild using a set of portable audio-video arrays

This repository contains all the necessary information to assemble, operate, deploy, and process data from the three eXperimental Audio-Video (XAV) arrays used for identifying fish sounds in the wild.

## Overview of the audio-video arrays

## Building and deploying the audio-video arrays
Building instructions and suggested deployment procedures can be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper. Deploymnet log sheets and and check lists can be found in the logsheets folder [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/tree/main/logsheets/).


## Acoustic localization

Acoustic localization in performed using either linearized inversion or fully non-linear inversion. We provide python code for both approaches. 

### Linearized inversion
The localization process using linearized inversion is described in this Jupyter Notebook using data from the large audio-video array.
The notebook can also be executed on Google Colab.

### Fully non-linear inversion
The localization process using fully non-limear inversion is described in this Jupyter Notebook using data from the mobile audio-video array.
The notebook can also be executed on Google Colab.
