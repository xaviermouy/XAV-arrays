# Identification of fish sounds in the wild using a set of portable audio-video arrays

This repository contains all the necessary information to assemble, operate, deploy, and process data from the three eXperimental Audio-Video (XAV) arrays used for identifying fish sounds in the wild.

## Overview of the audio-video arrays

## Building and deploying the audio-video arrays
Building instructions and suggested deployment procedures can be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper. Deploymnet log sheets and and check lists can be found in the [logsheets](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/tree/main/logsheets/) folder.


## 3D acoustic localization

Acoustic localization in performed using either linearized inversion or fully non-linear inversion.
We provide python code for both approaches. 

### Linearized inversion
The localization process using linearized inversion is described in this Jupyter Notebook using data from the large audio-video array.
The notebook can also be directly executed on Google Collab here.

### Fully non-linear inversion
The localization process using fully non-limear inversion is described in this Jupyter Notebook using data from the mobile audio-video array.
The notebook can also be directly executed on Google Collab here.
