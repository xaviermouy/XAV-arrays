## Abstract:

## Assembly and deployment of the audio-video arrays
Building instructions and suggested deployment procedures can be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper. Deploymnet log sheets and and check lists can be found in the logsheets folder [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/tree/main/logsheets/).

## Sample data
Two small sets of acoustic data from the large and mobile arrays are provided in this repository and used to show how the acoutsic localization works (see section below). All the acoustic data used in the paper can be found on teh OSF data repository of the paper.

* **Data from the large array**: [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/tree/main/localization/large-array)
* **Data from the mobile array**: [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/tree/main/localization/mobile-array)

## Acoustic localization
Acoustic localization is performed using either linearized inversion or fully non-linear inversion. We provide python code for both approaches. 

* **Linearized inversion**:
    * Jupyter Notebook: [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/blob/main/localization/Localization_linearized_inversion.ipynb)
    * GoogleColab Notebook: -> not done yet

* **Fully non-linear inversion**:
    * Jupyter Notebook: [here](https://github.com/xaviermouy/XAV-arrays/blob/main/localization/Localization_non-inear_inversion.ipynb)
    * GoogleColab Notebook: -> not done yet
